    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Polish potato pancakes, known as placki kartoflane or placki ziemniaczane in Polish, are delicious and delightful. This traditional recipe comes from Gwizda≈Çy village in the Mazovia region of Poland and it's surprisingly easy.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 medium potatoes, peeled and finely grated (about 2 1/4 pounds total)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely grated</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>Kosher salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour, more as needed</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
        <li>Granulated sugar, for garnish</li>
        <li>Sour cream, for garnish</li>
        <li>Applesauce, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Add the potatoes, onion, eggs, 2 teaspoons salt, and pepper to a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Add enough flour to bind the mixture together while leaving it somewhat thin.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet set over medium-high heat, add vegetable oil to a depth of about 1/4-inch. Heat until hot, but not smoking.</li>
        <li>Drop a 1/4 cup of potato mixture into the skillet and spread out to form a 3-inch circle that's about 1/4-inch thick.</li>
        <li>Fry until brown on the bottom (don't turn until the pancake is brown or it will stick), about 3 to 5 minutes. If needed reduce the heat to medium to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Turn the pancake and fry the other side for 3 to 5 minutes or until golden brown and crisp.</li>
        <li>Drain on paper towels. Serve with granulated sugar sour cream and applesauce if desired.</li>
    </ol>
