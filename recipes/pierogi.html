    <h2>Description</h2>

        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
        <li>150ml warm water</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift the flour into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the centre. Fill the well with the salt, oil and water. Using your fingers, gradually stir the flour into the wet ingredients, until the mixture comes together as a soft dough.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 5-8 minutes, or until it is smooth and glossy. Wrap the dough in a clean tea towel and set aside to rest in a cool room for at least 20 minutes.</li>

    <h3>Fillings ingredients:</h3>

    <h4>Pierogi Ruskie:</h4>
   
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>250g/9oz floury potatoes, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, finely diced</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the potatoes in a pan of salted water until soft enough to mash (about 20 minutes). Drain well and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and fry the onions for 4-5 minutes, or until crisp and browned. Reserve a tablespoonful of the onions for the garnish.</li>
        <li>When the potatoes have cooled, transfer them to a large bowl and crumble over the cottage cheese. Mash until smooth, then stir in the fried onions until well combined. Set aside.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Shaping and cooking:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Roll out the dough onto a lightly floured surface to a thickness of 3mm. Cut 10cm/4in rounds from it using a pastry cutter.</li>
        <li>Place one teaspoonful of your filling of choice into the pastry rounds. Brush a little water around the edge of each pastry round, then fold the edges together to create a bulging semi-circular dumpling, pressing the edges together to seal.</li>
        <li>Poach the pierogi, in batches if necessary, in a deep-sided pan of boiling water for 3-4 minutes, or until they float to the surface.</li>
        <li>To serve, pile the pierogi onto serving plates and serve the soured cream in small bowls alongside. Sprinkle with the reserved fried onions and the dill.</li>   
    </ol>
